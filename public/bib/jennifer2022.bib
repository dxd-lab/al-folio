abstract = {A growing number of organizations are hiring autistic individuals as they start to recognize the value of a neurodiverse workforce. Despite this trend, the lack of support for autistic employees in workplaces complicates their employment. However, little is known about how people around autistic individuals can support them to create pleasant employment experiences. In this work, we develop the concept of the Workplace Playbook VR to investigate how virtual reality (VR) can help autistic people develop their work-related social communication skills in partnership with people in their support network. Using a video prototype to present the concept, we interviewed 28 participants, including 10 autistic people and 18 members of their support networks, which included family members and professionals. Our interviews revealed that the Workplace Playbook VR program can provide common ground for autistic people and members of their support network to participate in more empathetic communication regarding workplace challenges. Despite the benefits, we identified the potential misuse of social communication skills training features of the VR program to correct the personal characteristics of autistic individuals. Furthermore, to cultivate inclusive workplace environments, we found the needs of VR development not only for autistic people but also for neurotypical employees to promote their understanding of autism and empathy toward autistic employees. We suggest VR designs that promote a sense of agency and self-advocacy for autistic employees, and autism awareness and acceptance training for neurotypical employees.},
