abstract = {People experience various stressful events in their daily lives. Receiving social support, especially from peers who went through a similar experience, helps individuals cope with such stress. We propose StressTrendmeter, a mobile application that targets college students for anonymously sharing the source of stress via the form of hashtags, viewing stress topics based on trends, and providing social support through the empathy button and hashtag-based chat. We deployed StressTrendmeter to 222 students from two universities for five weeks. With hashtags and trending features, students found StressTrendmeter (i)helpful to spontaneously yet concisely articulate their stress topics and (ii) easy to browse through and become aware of issues around the campus. Our study reveals that social sharing with StressTrendmeter brought awareness, resonance, and accountability as students empathized and expressed support. Based on our study, we share design implications for social support systems with community awareness.},
