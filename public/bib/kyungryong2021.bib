abstract = {Although audiobooks are increasingly being used, people tend to perceive audiobook experiences as 'not real reading' due to its intangibility and ephemerality. In this paper, we developed ADIO, a device augmenting audiobook experience through representing personal listening state in the form of an interactive physical bookshelf. ADIO displays a user's listening progress through a pendant's changing length and the user's digital audiobook archive titles. The result of our four-week in-field study with six participants revealed that ADIO provided proof of the user's listening-to, which brought a sense of reading and gave a trigger for recalling the listened-to audiobook content. Additionally, audiobooks' improved visibility reminded participants to listen to them, and ADIO's physical interaction allowed participants to form personal patterns for listening to audiobooks. Our findings proposed new methods for augmenting the audiobook listening experience at three stages and further implications for designing physical curation on usersâ€™ digital archives.},
