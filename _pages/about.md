The DxD Lab is an interdisciplinary research group within the Industrial Design Department at KAIST.  We explore design from, with, and by data to develop technologies that are more sensitive to human concerns and behaviors. Our research aims to build a more inclusive society by understanding the social impact of data and AI and by making technology accountable and accessible. Our current projects are developing human-centered and participatory approaches to designing algorithmic systems that are transparent, reliable, and responsive to community values and needs.
