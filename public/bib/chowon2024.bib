abstract = {The reliability of online dating algorithms has sparked considerable debate, particularly regarding skepticism about their excessive emphasis on evaluating and getting evaluated, which often overshadows the quest for authentic romantic connections. To understand the multifaceted influence of dating algorithms on end-users and explore avenues for algorithmic features considering the dynamics of human relationships, we conducted a mixed-methods study comprising in-depth interviews (N = 22) and a metaphoric co-design workshop (N = 12) with active users of online dating platforms. Interviews revealed that users perceive and respond to algorithmic evaluations with varied perceptions and behaviors, often expressing concerns about the emotional burden of constant self-presentation and the pursuit of quantitative assessments over genuine connections. In the design workshop, users envisioned desired algorithmic features to overcome investigated challenges, such as prioritizing personal values, tailored matchmaking, and support for personal growth in relationships. This research contributes to unraveling the complex dynamics of human-algorithm interaction in the context of online dating. By aligning algorithmic functions more closely with user desires and relationship goals, this study paves the way for more meaningful and authentic connections in the digital dating landscape.},
