abstract = {Contact tracing, a major way to curb COVID-19 and other epidemics, has been employed worldwide, with human interviewing and proximity tracing technology as two major approaches. While previous research has contributed some understanding of people's perspectives on contact tracing technology, much of this is based in single countries or regions where technology has been deployed. To understand how culture influences people's perceptions toward human tracing and digital tracing, we replicated a mixed-methods survey study conducted in the U.S. in South Korea and compared participants' perspectives. South Korean participants preferred digital tracing to human tracing, contrasting with the U.S. context where no strong preference was observed. We discuss how observed differences in perspective align and contrast with the country's typical cultural dimensions, such as high power distance, informing the perspective that human tracing will have greater accuracy. We emphasize the need for culturally designing contact tracing technology to highlight personal benefits regardless of cultural dimensions, and leverage technology to support social interaction in human tracing.},
