abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) continuously evolves its level of complexity as it interacts with users. To address the unexpected outcomes of AI, developers desire to communicate with prospective users and reflect their opinions in the AI design pipeline. In this paper, we introduce the “AI story relay,” a method by which the AI developer and users collaboratively construct a design fiction in a relay for AI design considerations. To explore the method’s potential that encourages communication between AI developers and users, we conducted a case study of an AI-based coaching service. We expect AI story relay to contribute to fostering a dynamic exchange of views between developers and prospective users.},
