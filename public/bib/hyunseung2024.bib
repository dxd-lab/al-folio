abstract = {Research promotion enables researchers to share advanced knowledge with pertinent academic communities. The question-and-answer (QA) style articles are effective for researchers to promote their research by enabling readers to understand research on complex subjects. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened avenues for supporting researchers in creating QA-style articles for research promotion. However, without the authors’ involvement, these models may only partially capture the researcher’s intention and voice. We developed AQUA, a research probe that enables researchers to co-create QA-style articles with LLMs to promote their research papers. A user study (n=12) reveals that LLMs reduced authors’ burden and helped them understand the readers’ perspectives. Nevertheless, LLMs failed to capture the unique intent of the authors, and their automated generation discouraged authors from carefully revising their answers. Based on our findings, we discuss human-LLM interaction design to enable authors to create QA-style articles that reflect their intention.},
